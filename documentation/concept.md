## Concept

Inspired by industrial assembly lines, we aimed for an approach to engineer a workstation where samples are being transported through customizable and reconfigurable modules. To do so, we developed (i) a modular concept, (ii) customizable hardware modules, and (iii) fully accessible application programming interface (API).

We describe a setup with a modular architecture, wherein we use one module respectively to implement a set of diverse functional elements. The base setup of the assembly line-inspired concept accommodates a pipetting and a transport module as essential elements. A transport module is required to move samples through the modules and, thereby, connects the implemented hardware modules with each other. A pipetting module is installed for essential pipetting operations which are required for almost every in vitro study. This general set up can then be customized to suit diverse experimental requirements by adding different numbers and kinds of hardware modules executing the desired functionality. Within these modules, each hardware module as well as the configuration of the hardware modules can be individually customized according to the experimental requirements. This ‘drag and drop’ approach enables a high degree of versatility, since the components as well as their configuration can be customized to fit the given requirements, including the option to remove components from the platform non-destructively without interfering with the functional operation of the other modules.

## General module description

#### Computational module
A computer is utilized to operate the workstation by providing an interface and sending the experimental protocol to the implemented control boards which forward commands to the functional parts of the hardware modules. A Python API has been developed to write protocol scripts to operate the entire workstation, and, thereby, all hardware modules in a synchronized mode. Python has been selected as the main programming language, since it is open source and a high-level and general-purpose dynamic language that focuses on code readability. Some of Python’s main advantages are (i) the extensive support libraries; (ii) the numerous third-party modules via the Python Package Index (PyPI) to enable interactions with other languages and platforms; (iii) the open source character and the community-driven development to facilitate collaborations and ease of use; and (iv) the increased productivity to build scalable multi-protocol network applications.

#### Control board module
A control board translates the received protocol script into a language to operate the functional components of the hardware modules. We selected the smoothieboard (The Smoothie Project, http://smoothieware.org) as the control board module due to the range of available sizes (e.g. from 3x to 5x axis control), the numerous capabilities (e.g. up to 5x axis control with 1/32 microstepping, 6x end stops, up to 3x MOSFETs with 12.5A max, and 3x MOSFETs with 3A max, ethernet and USB connections), the 32-bit microcontroller, the available documentation, and the overall quality to price ratio. The Smoothie Project is an open source project supported by the community to design open source hardware controllers with open source firmware (https://github.com/Smoothieware). The following motion control boards can be recommended as alternatives, but have not been tested and might require additional software engineering for successful implementation: Duet3D , Panucatt Azteeg X5 GT , TinyG CNC Controller Board .

#### Hardware modules
The customized hardware modules operate a set of specific functions required to execute the experiment. The combination of functional components into one hardware module introduces an efficient and agile approach, since a single module can be easily modified without interfering with other modules. To do so, functional components are integrated into an aluminium frame to enable easy module handling and provide a robust solution for moving parts. Moreover, the various connection modes of the aluminium profiles (e.g. t-slots, nuts, threated holes, corner brackets, etc.) enable fast and inexpensive design iterations. Pre-configured aluminium frames as well as assembled mechanical parts (e.g. linear stages) are available for developers as ready-to-use assemblies to support and accelerate the design and development process. Under section 2.4, we demonstrate the feasibility for customized hardware module development and, subsequently, successful adoption of this concept for laboratory automation in the context of a case study.

#### Monitoring modules
As monitoring capability, we understand the measurement of process variables either continuously and/or repeatedly during the course of the experiment. In general, monitoring modules may include camera-based systems or various sensor types (e.g. temperature, pH, oxygen, lactate, etc.) to record the variables and document the changes over time. Implemented functions can also be used in the sense of an in-process control unit to automatically adjust operational variables via advanced process algorithms. Such in-process control units ensure consistent product quality or reach defined product output specifications.
