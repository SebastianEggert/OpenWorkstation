## Hardware

The hardware section is divided into CAD files (SolidWorks) used to build the presented workstation (incl modules) and a parts library to accelerate the development process for new modules in the future.

All hardware files are available for the presented workstation:

 * [Assembled workstation](workstation)
 * [Pipetting module](modulePipetting)  
 * [Crosslinker module](moduleCrosslinker)
 * [Storage module](moduleStorage)
 * [Transport module](moduleTransport)
 * [Base frame](base-frame)

The following libraries are available to support users during the development of new module:

 * [Aluminium profiles](aluminium-profiles)
 * [Module frames](moduleFrame)
 * [OpenBuilds parts](OpenBuilds)

OpenBuilds provides additional support via their [SolidWorks part library](https://openbuilds.com/projectresources/solidworks-2014-parts-library.160/) and the uploaded models on [GrabCAD](https://grabcad.com/openbuilds-1/models).
