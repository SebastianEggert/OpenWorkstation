 ## Overview

 We present a general Open Source Hardware (OSH) concept to develop scientific equipment. This concept enables the integration of available and newly developed OSH projects to a modular workstation. Building upon the [Opentrons API](https://github.com/Opentrons/opentrons),

 Specifically, the OpenWorkstation concept provides these features:

 * feature 1
 * feature 2
 * feature 3
 * feature 4

 ## OpenWorkstation API

 Following [Opentrons](https://github.com/Opentrons/opentrons) approach, the OpenWorkstation is a simple Python framework designed to allow the operation of hardware modules. Basic commands are written in the [Gcode language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-code) to enable custimzation and make it accessible to anyone with basic programming skills.

 ## Development status

 The OpenWorkstation projects is an open source project. The concept was developed in the labs of the [ARC Industrial Transformation Training Centre in Additive Biomanufacturing](http://additivebiomanufacturing.org) to simplify the design and development of automated solutions. The OpenWorkstation project remains under active development and new features continue to be integrated.

 Please do no hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:s.eggert@qut.edu.au) to provide feedback and discuss potential applications.

 ## Getting started

 The documentation is divided into three sections:

 * [Concept](docs/concept.md) describes what you will need, and the set-up of both hardware and software.
 * [Pre-requisites and installation](docs/installation.md) describes what you will need, and the set-up of both hardware and software.
 * [Deck setup and calibration](DeckSetupAndCalibration.md) describes the initial calibration procedures that are required to teach the robot where you will place your labware.
 * The [PlasmoTron tutorial](Tutorial.md) will explain how, once this initial setup is complete, you can use PlasmoTron to maintain malaria parasites.
