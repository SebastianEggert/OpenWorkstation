Heat Deck
**********

The heat deck runs off the opensource platform Arduino, which is how you can control it's temperature. Our heat decks come automatically set to reach a temperature of 55 deg Celsius, but you can edit this value by editing the Arduino file.

Find our Heat Deck source code `on GitHub here`__, and download.

__ https://github.com/opentrons/opentrons-modules

Also download and install the `Arduino IDE`__.

__ https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software

Open the file, and you will see detailed instruction for how to update the temperature. The overiew is that you simply set the number for what temperature you want, then upload that code to the Heat Deck.

Setting up Hardware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use your included DIY Mag Bead kit to configure the motor control board (see kit instructions).


Initializing Module in API
============================

Just like a pipette, you need to set up and name your module.

**instruments.Magbead** (*mofset, name*)

	* **mosfet -** integer 0-5 (defaults to 0)
	* **name -** the name you want to call your module

.. testsetup:: main

  from opentrons import instruments
  from opentrons.instruments import Pipette
  p200 = instruments.Pipette(axis="b", max_volume=200)

.. testcode:: main

	mag_deck = instruments.Magbead(name='mag_deck')

Activate and Deactivate Magnets 
================================

To activate the magnets and raise the module's platform, run ``.engage()``:

**module.engage** ()

.. testcode:: main

	mag_deck.engage()

To deactivate the magnets and lower the module's platform, run ``.disengage()``:

**module.disengage** ()

.. testcode:: main

	mag_deck.disengage()

Chain Other Commands
============================

Just like ``aspirate()`` and ``dispense()`` can be chained, you can chain ``engage()`` and ``disengage()``, as well as the ``delay()`` if you don't want to do anything between engaging and disengaging the magnets.

.. testcode:: main

	mag_deck.engage()
	mag_deck.delay(60)
	mag_deck.disengage()

	mag_deck.engage().delay(60).disengage()

You can call ``delay()`` with a ``Pipette`` or a ``Magbead`` module.

.. testcode:: main

	p200.delay(10)
	mag_deck.delay(10)
