All examples on this page assume the following containers and pipette:

.. testcode:: examples

  from opentrons import robot, containers, instruments

  plate = containers.load('96-flat', 'B1')
  trough = containers.load('trough-12row', 'C1')

  tiprack_1 = containers.load('tiprack-200ul', 'A1')
  tiprack_2 = containers.load('tiprack-200ul', 'A2') 
      
  p200 = instruments.Pipette(
      axis="b",
      max_volume=200,
      tip_racks=[tiprack_2])

***************
Basic Transfer
***************

Moving 100uL from one well to another:

.. testcode:: examples
  
  p200.transfer(100, plate.wells('A1'), plate.wells('B1'))

If you prefer to not use the ``.transfer()`` command, the following pipette commands will create the some results:

.. testcode:: examples

  p200.pick_up_tip()
  p200.aspirate(100, plate.wells('A1'))
  p200.dispense(100, plate.wells('A1'))
  p200.return_tip()

******************************

*****
Loops
*****

Loops in Python allows your protocol to perform many actions, or act upon many wells, all within just a few lines. The below example loops through the numbers ``0`` to ``11``, and uses that loop's current value to transfer from all wells in a trough to each row of a plate:

.. testcode:: examples

  # distribute 20uL from trough:A1 -> plate:row:1
  # distribute 20uL from trough:A2 -> plate:row:2
  # etc...

  # ranges() starts at 0 and stops at 12, creating a range of 0-11
  for i in range(12):
    p200.distribute(20, trough.wells(i), plate.rows(i))

******************************

*******************
Multiple Air Gaps
*******************

The opentrons liquid handler can do some things that a human cannot do with a pipette, like accurately alternate between aspirating and creating air gaps within the same tip. The below example will aspirate from five wells in the trough, while creating a air gap between each sample.

.. testcode:: examples
  
  p200.pick_up_tip()

  for well in trough.wells():
    p200.aspirate(5, well).air_gap(10)

  p200.dispense(plate.wells('A1'))

  p200.return_tip()

******************************

***************
Dilution
***************

This example first spreads a dilutent to all wells of a plate. It then dilutes 8 samples from the trough across the 8 columns of the plate.

.. testcode:: examples

  p200.distribute(50, trough.wells('A12'), plate.wells())  # dilutent

  # loop through each column
  for i in range(8):

    # save the source well and destination column to variables
    source = trough.wells(i)
    column = plate.cols(i)

    # transfer 10uL of source to first well in column
    p200.transfer(10, source, column.wells('1'))

    # dilute the sample down the column
    p200.transfer(
      10, column.wells('1', to='11'), column.wells('2', to='12'),
      mix_after=(3, 25))

******************************

***************
Plate Mapping
***************

Deposit various volumes of liquids into the same plate of wells, and automatically refill the tip volume when it runs out.

.. testcode:: examples

  # these uL values were created randomly for this example
  water_volumes = [
    1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,
    9,  10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,

    25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32,
    33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40,
    41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48,

    81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88,
    89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96
  ]

  p200.distribute(water_volumes, trough.wells('A12'), plate)

The final volumes can also be read from a CSV, and opened by your protocol.

    This example uses a CSV file saved on the same computer, formatted as follows,
    where the columns in the file represent the 8 columns of the plate,
    and the rows in the file represent the 12 rows of the plate,
    and the values represent the uL that must end up at that location

Precision Pipetting
*******************

This example shows how to deposit liquid around the edge of a well.

.. testcode:: examples

  p200.pick_up_tip()

  # rotate around the edge of the well, dropping 10ul at a time
  theta = 0.0
  while p200.current_volume > 0:
      # we can move around a circle with radius (r) and theta (degrees)
      well_edge = plate.wells('B1').from_center(r=1.0, theta=theta, h=0.9)
      
      # combine a Well with a Vector in a tuple
      destination = (plate.wells('B1'), well_edge)
      p200.move_to(destination, strategy='direct')  # move straight there
      p200.dispense(10)
      
      theta += 0.314

  p200.drop_tip()
