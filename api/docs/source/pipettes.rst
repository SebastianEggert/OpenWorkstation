The ``instruments`` module gives your protocol access to the ``Pipette``, which is what you will be primarily using to create protocol commands.

******************
Creating a Pipette
******************

.. testcode:: pipettes

    '''
    Examples in this section require the following
    '''
    from opentrons import instruments

Axis and Max Volume
===================

To create a ``Pipette``, you must give it an axis and a max_volume. The axis can be either ``'a'`` or ``'b'``, and the volume is whatever your hand pipette is calibrated for. In this example, we are using a 200uL pipette.

.. testcode:: pipettes

    pipette = instruments.Pipette(
        axis='b',
        name='my-p200',
        max_volume=200)

Minimum Volume
==============

The minimum allowed volume can be set for each pipette. If your protocol attempts to aspirate or dispense a volume below this volume, the API will give you a warning.

.. testcode:: pipettes

    pipette = instruments.Pipette(
        axis='b',
        name='my-p200',
        max_volume=200,
        min_volume=20)

Channels
========

Pipettes can also be assigned a number of channels, either ``channel=1`` or ``channel=8``. If you do not specify, it will default to ``channel=1`` channel.

.. testcode:: pipettes

    pipette = instruments.Pipette(
        axis='b',
        name='my-p200-multichannel',
        max_volume=200,
        min_volume=20,
        channels=8)

Plunger Speeds
==============

The speeds at which the pipette will aspirate and dispense can be set through ``aspirate_speed`` and ``dispense_speed``. The values are in millimeters/minute, and default to ``aspirate_speed=300`` and ``dispense_speed=500``.

.. testcode:: pipettes

    pipeipette = instruments.Pipette(
        axis='b',
        name='my-p200-multichannel',
        max_volume=200,
        min_volume=20,
        channels=8,
        aspirate_speed=200,
        dispense_speed=600)

.. testsetup:: robot

    from opentrons import robot, containers, instruments

    robot.reset()

    plate = containers.load('96-flat', 'B1', 'my-plate')
    tiprack = containers.load('tiprack-200ul', 'A1', 'my-rack')

    pipette = instruments.Pipette(axis='b', max_volume=200, name='my-pipette')


**********************

**************
Tip Handling
**************

When we handle liquids with a pipette, we are constantly exchanging old, used tips for new ones to prevent cross-contamination between our wells. To help with this constant need, we describe in this section a few methods for getting new tips, and removing tips from a pipette.

**********************

.. testsetup:: tips

    from opentrons import containers, instruments, robot

    robot.reset()

    trash = containers.load('point', 'D2')
    tiprack = containers.load('tiprack-200ul', 'B1')

    pipette = instruments.Pipette(axis='a')

This section demonstrates the options available for controlling tips

.. testcode:: tips
    
    '''
    Examples in this section expect the following
    '''
    from opentrons import containers, instruments

    trash = containers.load('point', 'D2')
    tiprack = containers.load('tiprack-200ul', 'B1')

    pipette = instruments.Pipette(axis='a')

Pick Up Tip
===========

Before any liquid handling can be done, your pipette must have a tip on it. The command ``pick_up_tip()`` will move the pipette over to the specified tip, the press down into it to create a vacuum seal. The below example picks up the tip at location ``'A1'``.

.. testcode:: tips

    pipette.pick_up_tip(tiprack.wells('A1'))

Drop Tip
===========

Once finished with a tip, the pipette will autonomously remove the tip when we call ``drop_tip()``. We can specify where to drop the tip by passing in a location. The below example drops the tip back at its originating location on the tip rack.

.. testcode:: tips

    pipette.drop_tip(tiprack.wells('A1'))

Instead of returning a tip to the tip rack, we can also drop it in a trash container.

.. testcode:: tips

    pipette.pick_up_tip(tiprack.wells('A2'))
    pipette.drop_tip(trash)

Return Tip
===========

When we need to return the tip to its originating location on the tip rack, we can simply call ``return_tip()``. The example below will automatically return the tip to ``'A3'`` on the tip rack.

.. testcode:: tips

    pipette.pick_up_tip(tiprack.wells('A3'))
    pipette.return_tip()

**********************

.. testsetup:: tipsiterating

    from opentrons import containers, instruments, robot

    robot.reset()

    trash = containers.load('point', 'D2')
    tip_rack_1 = containers.load('tiprack-200ul', 'B1')
    tip_rack_2 = containers.load('tiprack-200ul', 'B2')

    pipette = instruments.Pipette(
        axis='b',
        tip_racks=[tip_rack_1, tip_rack_2],
        trash_container=trash
    )

Tips Iterating
==============

Automatically iterate through tips and drop tip in trash by attaching containers to a pipette

.. testcode:: tipsiterating
    
    '''
    Examples in this section expect the following
    '''
    from opentrons import containers, instruments

    trash = containers.load('point', 'D2')
    tip_rack_1 = containers.load('tiprack-200ul', 'B1')
    tip_rack_2 = containers.load('tiprack-200ul', 'B2')

Attach Tip Rack to Pipette
--------------------------

Tip racks and trash containers can be "attached" to a pipette when the pipette is created. This give the pipette the ability to automatically iterate through tips, and to automatically send the tip to the trash container.

Trash containers can be attached with the option ``trash_container=TRASH_CONTAINER``.

Multiple tip racks are can be attached with the option ``tip_racks=[RACK_1, RACK_2, etc... ]``.

.. testcode:: tipsiterating

    pipette = instruments.Pipette(
        axis='b',
        tip_racks=[tip_rack_1, tip_rack_2],
        trash_container=trash
    )

.. note::

    The ``tip_racks=`` option expects us to give it a Python list, containing each tip rack we want to attach. If we are only attaching one tip rack, then the list will have a length of one, like the following:

    ``tip_racks=[tiprack]``


Iterating Through Tips
----------------------

Now that we have two tip racks attached to the pipette, we can automatically step through each tip whenever we call ``pick_up_tip()``. We then have the option to either ``return_tip()`` to the tip rack, or we can ``drop_tip()`` to remove the tip in the attached trash container.

.. testcode:: tipsiterating

    pipette.pick_up_tip()  # picks up tip_rack_1:A1
    pipette.return_tip()
    pipette.pick_up_tip()  # picks up tip_rack_1:A2
    pipette.drop_tip()     # automatically drops in trash

    # use loop to pick up tips tip_rack_1:A3 through tip_rack_2:H12
    for i in range(94 + 96):
        pipette.pick_up_tip()
        pipette.return_tip()

If we try to ``pick_up_tip()`` again when all the tips have been used, the opentrons API will show you an error.

.. note::

    If you run the cell above, and then uncomment and run the cell below, you will get an error because the pipette is out of tips.

.. testcode:: tipsiterating

    # this will raise an exception if run after the previous code block
    # pipette.pick_up_tip()


Select Starting Tip
-------------------

Calls to ``pick_up_tip()`` will by default start at the attached tip rack's ``'A1'`` location. If you however want to start automatic tip iterating at a different tip, you can use ``start_at_tip()``.

.. testcode:: tipsiterating

    pipette.reset()

    pipette.start_at_tip(tip_rack_1['C3'])
    pipette.pick_up_tip()  # pick up C3 from "tip_rack_1"
    pipette.return_tip()

Get Current Tip
---------------

Get the source location of the pipette's current tip by calling ``current_tip()``. If the tip was from the ``'A1'`` position on our tip rack, ``current_tip()`` will return that position.

.. testcode:: tipsiterating

    print(pipette.current_tip())  # is holding no tip

    pipette.pick_up_tip()
    print(pipette.current_tip())  # is holding the next available tip

    pipette.return_tip()
    print(pipette.current_tip())  # is holding no tip

will print out...

.. testoutput:: tipsiterating

    None
    <Well D3>
    None

****************
Liquid Control
****************

This is the fun section, where we get to move things around and pipette! This section describes the ``Pipette`` object's many liquid-handling commands, as well as how to move the ``robot``.

**********************

.. testsetup:: liquid

    from opentrons import containers, instruments, robot

    robot.reset()

    plate = containers.load('96-flat', 'B1')
    pipette = instruments.Pipette(axis='b', max_volume=200)

.. testcode:: liquid
    
    '''
    Examples in this section expect the following
    '''
    from opentrons import containers, instruments

    plate = containers.load('96-flat', 'B1')
    pipette = instruments.Pipette(axis='b', max_volume=200)


Aspirate
========

To aspirate is to pull liquid up into the pipette's tip. When calling aspirate on a pipette, we can specify how many micoliters, and at which location, to draw liquid from:

.. testcode:: liquid

    pipette.aspirate(50, plate.wells('A1'))  # aspirate 50uL from plate:A1

Now our pipette's tip is holding 50uL.

We can also simply specify how many microliters to aspirate, and not mention a location. The pipette in this circumstance will aspirate from it's current location (which we previously set as ``plate.wells('A1'))``.

.. testcode:: liquid

    pipette.aspirate(50)                     # aspirate 50uL from current position

Now our pipette's tip is holding 100uL.

We can also specify only the location to aspirate from. If we do not tell the pipette how many micoliters to aspirate, it will by default fill up the remaining volume in it's tip. In this example, since we already have 100uL in the tip, the pipette will aspirate another 100uL

.. testcode:: liquid

    pipette.aspirate(plate.wells('A2'))      # aspirate until pipette fills from plate:A2


Dispense
========

To dispense is to push out liquid from the pipette's tip. It's usage in the opentrons API is nearly identical to ``aspirate()``, in that you can specify microliters and location, only microliters, or only a location:

.. testcode:: liquid

    pipette.dispense(50, plate.wells('B1')) # dispense 50uL to plate:B1
    pipette.dispense(50)                    # dispense 50uL to current position
    pipette.dispense(plate.wells('B2'))     # dispense until pipette empties to plate:B2

That final dispense without specifying a micoliter amount will dispense all remaining liquids in the tip to ``plate.wells('B2')``, and now our pipette is empty.

Blow Out
========

To blow out is to push an extra amount of air through the pipette's tip, so as to make sure that any remaining droplets are expelled.

When calling ``blow_out()`` on a pipette, we have the option to specify a location to blow out the remaining liquid. If no location is specified, the pipette will blow out from it's current position.

.. testcode:: liquid

    pipette.blow_out()                  # blow out over current location
    pipette.blow_out(plate.wells('B3')) # blow out over current plate:B3


Touch Tip
=========

To touch tip is to move the pipette's currently attached tip to the edges of a well, for the purpose of knocking off any droplets that might be hanging from the tip.

When calling ``touch_tip()`` on a pipette, we have the option to specify a location where the tip will touch the inner walls. If no location is specified, the pipette will touch tip inside it's current location.

.. testcode:: liquid

    pipette.touch_tip()                  # touch tip within current location
    pipette.touch_tip(-2)                # touch tip 2mm below the top of the current location
    pipette.touch_tip(plate.wells('B1')) # touch tip within plate:B1


Mix
===

Mixing is simply performing a series of ``aspirate()`` and ``dispense()`` commands in a row on a single location. However, instead of having to write those commands out every time, the opentrons API allows you to simply say ``mix()``.

The mix command takes three arguments: ``mix(repetitions, volume, location)``

.. testcode:: liquid

    pipette.mix(4, 100, plate.wells('A2'))   # mix 4 times, 100uL, in plate:A2
    pipette.mix(3, 50)                       # mix 3 times, 50uL, in current location
    pipette.mix(2)                           # mix 2 times, pipette's max volume, in current location


Air Gap
=======

Some liquids need an extra amount of air in the pipette's tip to prevent it from sliding out. A call to ``air_gap()`` with a microliter amount will aspirate that much air into the tip.

.. testcode:: liquid

    pipette.aspirate(100, plate.wells('B4'))
    pipette.air_gap(20)

**********************

.. testsetup:: moving

    from opentrons import robot, containers, instruments

    robot.reset()

    tiprack = containers.load('tiprack-200ul', 'A1')
    plate = containers.load('96-flat', 'B1')

    pipette = instruments.Pipette(axis='b')

******
Moving
******

Demonstrates the different ways to control the movement of the opentrons liquid handler during a protocol run.

.. testcode:: moving
    
    '''
    Examples in this section expect the following
    '''
    from opentrons import containers, instruments, robot

    tiprack = containers.load('tiprack-200ul', 'A1')
    plate = containers.load('96-flat', 'B1')

    pipette = instruments.Pipette(axis='b')

Move To
=======

Pipette's are able to ``move_to()`` any location on the deck.

For example, we can move to the first tip in our tip rack:

.. testcode:: moving

    pipette.move_to(tiprack.wells('A1'))

You can also specify at what height you would like the robot to move to inside of a location using ``top()`` and ``bottom()`` methods on that location.

.. testcode:: moving

    pipette.move_to(plate.wells('A1').bottom())  # move to the bottom of well A1
    pipette.move_to(plate.wells('A1').top())     # move to the top of well A1
    pipette.move_to(plate.wells('A1').bottom(2)) # move to 2mm above the bottom of well A1
    pipette.move_to(plate.wells('A1').top(-2))   # move to 2mm below the top of well A1

The above commands will cause the robot's head to first move upwards, then over to above the target location, then finally downwards until the target location is reached. If instead you would like the robot to mive in a straight line to the target location, you can set the movement strategy to ``'direct'``.

.. testcode:: moving

    pipette.move_to(plate.wells('A1'), strategy='direct')

.. note::
    
    Moving with ``strategy='direct'`` will run the risk of colliding with things on your deck. Be very careful when using the option.

Usually the ``strategy='direct'`` option is useful when moving inside of a well. Take a look at the below sequence of movements, which first move the head to a well, and use 'direct' movements inside that well, then finally move on to a different well.

.. testcode:: moving

    pipette.move_to(plate.wells('A1'))
    pipette.move_to(plate.wells('A1').bottom(1), strategy='direct')
    pipette.move_to(plate.wells('A1').top(-2), strategy='direct')
    pipette.move_to(plate.wells('A1'))

Delay
=====

To have your protocol pause for any given number of minutes or seconds, simply call ``delay()`` on your pipette. The value passed into ``delay()`` is the number of minutes or seconds the robot will wait until moving on to the next commands.

.. testcode:: moving

    pipette.delay(seconds=2)             # pause for 2 seconds
    pipette.delay(minutes=5)             # pause for 5 minutes
    pipette.delay(minutes=5, seconds=2)  # pause for 5 minutes and 2 seconds
