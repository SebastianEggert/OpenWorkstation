.. testsetup:: robot

    from opentrons import containers, instruments, robot
    from opentrons.instruments import pipette as _pipette

    robot.reset()

###################
Advanced Control
###################

.. note::

    The below features are designed for advanced users who wish to use the opentrons API in their own Python environment (ie Jupyter). This page is not relevant for users only using the opentrons App, because the features described below will not be accessible.

The robot module can be thought of as the parent for all aspects of the opentrons API. All containers, instruments, and protocol commands are added to and controlled by robot.

.. testcode:: robot

    '''
    Examples in this section require the following
    '''
    from opentrons import robot, containers, instruments

    plate = containers.load('96-flat', 'B1', 'my-plate')
    tiprack = containers.load('tiprack-200ul', 'A1', 'my-rack')

    pipette = instruments.Pipette(axis='b', max_volume=200, name='my-pipette')

Head Speed
==========

The maximum speed of the robot's head can be set using ``robot.head_speed()``. The value we set the speed to is in millimeters-per-second (mm/sec).

.. testcode:: robot

    robot.head_speed(5000)

.. note::

    Setting the head speed to above ``6000 mm/sec`` may cause your robot to "skip", which means the motors will lose their grip and make a loud vibrating noise. We recommend you try out different speed values on your robot, and see what works and what doesn't.

Homing
======

You can `home` the robot by calling ``home()``. You can also specify axes. The robot will home immdediately when this call is made.

.. testcode:: robot

    robot.home()           # home the robot on all axis
    robot.home('z')        # home the Z axis only

Commands
========

When commands are called on a pipette, they are recorded on the ``robot`` in the order they are called. You can see all past executed commands by calling ``robot.commands()``, which returns a `Python list`__.

__ https://docs.python.org/3.5/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists

.. testcode:: robot
    
    pipette.pick_up_tip(tiprack.wells('A1'))
    pipette.drop_tip(tiprack.wells('A1'))

    for c in robot.commands():
        print(c)

will print out...

.. testoutput:: robot
    :options: -ELLIPSIS, +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

    Picking up tip from <Deck><Slot A1><Container my-rack><Well A1>
    Drop_tip at <Deck><Slot A1><Container my-rack><Well A1>

Clear Commands
==============

We can erase the robot command history by calling ``robot.clear_commands()``. Any previously created instruments and containers will still be inside robot, but the commands history is erased.

.. testcode:: robot
    
    robot.clear_commands()
    pipette.pick_up_tip(tiprack['A1'])
    print('There is', len(robot.commands()), 'command')

    robot.clear_commands()
    print('There are now', len(robot.commands()), 'commands')

will print out...

.. testoutput:: robot
    :options: -ELLIPSIS, +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

    There is 1 command
    There are now 0 commands

Comment
=======

You can add a custom message to the list of command descriptions you see when running ``robot.commands()``. This command is ``robot.comment()``, and it allows you to print out any information you want at the point in your protocol

.. testcode:: robot
    
    robot.clear_commands()

    pipette.pick_up_tip(tiprack['A1'])
    robot.comment("Hello, just picked up tip A1")

    pipette.pick_up_tip(tiprack['A1'])
    robot.comment("Goodbye, just dropped tip A1")

    for c in robot.commands():
        print(c)

will print out...

.. testoutput:: robot
    :options: -ELLIPSIS, +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

    Picking up tip from <Deck><Slot A1><Container my-rack><Well A1>
    Hello, just picked up tip A1
    Picking up tip from <Deck><Slot A1><Container my-rack><Well A1>
    Goodbye, just dropped tip A1

Get Containers
==============

When containers are loaded, they are automatically added to the ``robot``. You can see all currently held containers by calling ``robot.get_containers()``, which returns a `Python list`__.

__ https://docs.python.org/3.5/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists

.. testcode:: robot
    
    for name, container in robot.get_containers():
        print(name, container.get_type())

will print out...

.. testoutput:: robot
    :options: -ELLIPSIS, +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

    my-plate 96-flat
    my-rack tiprack-200ul

Get Instruments
===============

When instruments are created, they are automatically added to the ``robot``. You can see all currently held instruments by calling ``robot.get_instruments()``, which returns a `Python list`__.

__ https://docs.python.org/3.5/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists

.. testcode:: robot
    
    for axis, pipette in robot.get_instruments():
        print(pipette.name, axis)

will print out...

.. testoutput:: robot
    :options: -ELLIPSIS, +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

    my-pipette B

Reset
=====

Calling ``robot.reset()`` will remove everything from the robot. Any previously added containers, pipettes, or commands will be erased.

.. testcode:: robot
    
    robot.reset()
    print(robot.get_containers())
    print(robot.get_instruments())
    print(robot.commands())

will print out...

.. testoutput:: robot
    :options: -ELLIPSIS, +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
