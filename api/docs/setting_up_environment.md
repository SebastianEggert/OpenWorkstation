# Start Writing opentrons Protocols with Jupyter 

Jupyter is an interactive programming environment that runs in the browser. Jupyter can support multiple programming languages but we will only be using it for Python 3.

### 1 - Install Anaconda and Python 3

To run opentrons you will need to ensure you have Python 3 installed. We recommend you install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) before going any further, this will install Python 3 for you. We recommend you use the `Graphical Installer` for `Python3.5`.

### 2 - Install Jupyter

After Anaconda and Python 3 are installed, you can get started installing Jupyter by following the official [Jupyter Installation Guide](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).

If you have finished setting up Python 3 and you have finished going through the Jupyter installation guide it is now time to run Jupyter.

### 3 - Launch Jupyter Notebook App:

##### With GUI -- *Reccomended for Beginners*
1. Install and open the Anaconda Navagator App you just downloaded.
2. Click 'Launch' under Jupyter Notebook.
3. A new Jupyter Notebook will open in a new browser window. 

##### In Terminal
1. Click on spotlight, type `terminal` to open a terminal window.
2. Create and Enter the startup folder by typing `mkdir some_folder_name && cd some_folder_name`.
3. Type `jupyter notebook` to launch the Jupyter Notebook App (it will appear in a new browser window or tab).

### 4 - Programming in Jupyter Notebook: Hello World!

When the Jupyter Notebook App is launched on your browser, follow these steps to open a `Notebook`

1. Navigate towards the `New` dropdown menu button towards the top right hand side of the screen Jupyter Notebook App. 
2. Click the `New` menu button and scroll down and click `python [conda root]`.

A new tab should open in your browser and you should have an empty text box.

3. Type `print('hello world')` in the text box. 
4. Scroll to the top menu bar and press they `play button >| ` to execute the code in the text box. This will cause Jupyter to execute the code in the text box and return you the computed result, which should be 'Hello World'.

### 5 - Install opentrons API

After running the aforementioned step a new text box will appear for you to write code in. We will use this text box to install the opentrons API.

* Copy paste this statement into the new text box `!pip install --upgrade opentrons`

The should execute the installation process of the opentrons API. The last line of this installation process should say `Successfully installed opentrons-sdk-1.0`

If you made it this far without any errors then you are done! You should treat yourself well tonight and celebrate your successes generously!
